      Maharashtra is home to some of the most remarkable <b>historical monuments</b> in India. 
      From ancient rock-cut caves to mighty forts and grand palaces, these sites narrate stories 
      of <i>art, architecture, culture, and bravery</i>. They reflect how people in the past 
      combined creativity with strategy, leaving behind treasures that still inspire us today.

  <p>
    The <span class="highlight">Ajanta Caves</span> (2nd century BCE) are world-famous rock-cut Buddhist caves,
    located near <b>Aurangabad, Maharashtra</b>. They consist of 30 caves carved into a horseshoe-shaped cliff
    overlooking the Waghora River. These caves were used as <b>monasteries and prayer halls</b> by Buddhist monks.  
    The walls are adorned with paintings that narrate <i>Jataka tales</i> (stories of Buddha’s past lives).  
    Ajanta marks the height of <b>ancient Indian art</b> and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

  <p>
    The <span class="highlight">Ellora Caves</span> (6th–10th century CE), located about 30 km from Aurangabad, 
    are a remarkable example of <b>religious tolerance and architectural brilliance</b>.  
    These 34 caves represent three religions — Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism — built side by side.  
    The most famous is the <b>Kailasa Temple</b>, carved out of a single rock, which is bigger than the Parthenon in Greece.  
    It is believed that over <b>7,000 laborers</b> worked for decades to complete it.  
    Today, Ellora is also a UNESCO site and a symbol of India’s cultural unity.

  <ul>
    <li>Carved between 600–1000 CE.</li>
    <li>34 caves: 17 Hindu, 12 Buddhist, 5 Jain.</li>

  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Raigad Fort</span>, located in the Sahyadri mountain range (about 140 km from Pune),
    was the <b>capital of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj</b>. At an elevation of 2,700 feet, it was considered almost
    impossible to conquer. Shivaji was crowned here in <b>1674 CE</b>, marking the birth of the Maratha Empire.  
    The fort had <b>strategic architecture</b>, with natural defenses, water reservoirs, and storehouses.  
    Even today, visitors climb over 1,700 stone steps or use a ropeway to reach the top, experiencing the pride of Maratha history.

  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Shaniwar Wada</span>, built in <b>1732</b> in Pune, was the grand residence of the Peshwas,
    who were prime ministers of the Maratha Empire. It was constructed using teak from Junnar, stones from Chinchwad,
    and lime from Jejuri — showing how carefully materials were chosen.  
    The palace had <b>five gates, fountains, and intricate gardens</b>.  
    Though much of it was destroyed by fire in 1828, its ruins still reflect the Maratha’s rich lifestyle.  
    Today, it is one of Pune’s most popular heritage sites, known for history and legends.

  <img src="https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/1180395.jpg" alt="Gateway of India, Mumbai">
  <p>
    The <span class="highlight">Gateway of India</span>, built in <b>1924</b> in Mumbai, is a major landmark and symbol of India’s colonial history.  
    It was constructed to commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary in 1911.  
    The structure is made of yellow basalt and reinforced concrete, combining Hindu and Muslim architectural styles.  
    It later became a departure point for the British in 1948, symbolizing India’s independence.

  <p>
    The <span class="highlight">Bibi Ka Maqbara</span>, built in <b>1660 CE</b> by Aurangzeb’s son Azam Shah in Aurangabad, 
    was constructed in memory of his mother, Dilras Banu Begum.  
    It is often called the “Taj of the Deccan” because of its striking resemblance to the Taj Mahal.  
    Though smaller in scale, it features a central dome, surrounding minarets, and Mughal-style gardens.  
  </p>
  <ul>

  <p>
    <span class="highlight">Daulatabad Fort</span>, near Aurangabad, is a 12th-century fort famous for its <b>ingenious defense mechanisms</b>.  
    Originally called Devagiri, it was once the capital of the Yadava dynasty and later briefly the capital of Muhammad bin Tughlaq.  
    The fort’s zig-zag pathways, false doors, and steep climb made it nearly impossible to capture.  
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Known for its impenetrable defense system.</li>
    <li>Had an optical illusion “Andheri” passage to trap enemies.</li>
    <li>Walls rise up to 30 feet high.</li>

  <h2>📊 Data Science & Monuments</h2>
  <p>
    Ancient monuments show us how people in history applied <span class="highlight">data, observation, and analysis</span> 
    long before computers existed. Builders and rulers made careful decisions using available knowledge — just like modern <b>Data Science</b>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>📍 <b>Raigad Fort</b> was chosen for its terrain advantage — like using <i>geographical data</i> for strategic planning.</li>
    <li>🪨 <b>Ellora engineers</b> studied rock layers to test <i>durability</i> before carving temples.</li>
    <li>🎨 <b>Ajanta Caves</b> were designed with natural light angles and sound reflection — early examples of <i>environmental analytics</i>.</li>
    <li>🛡️ <b>Daulatabad Fort</b> used confusing layouts and hidden traps — a form of <i>behavioral prediction</i> against enemies.</li>
    <li>💻 Today, Data Science helps in <b>heritage conservation</b> using 3D laser scanning, visitor data analysis, and digital archives to protect monuments for the future.</li>
