  <p>
    Ancient India was a land where knowledge was not only preserved but expanded upon. 
    Among its greatest achievements were <span class="highlight">mathematics</span> 
    and <span class="highlight">astronomy</span>. Scholars observed the skies, 
    recorded data, and transformed patterns into formulas‚Äîmuch like how 
    <span class="highlight">data science</span> works today.
  </p>

  <!-- Aryabhata -->
  <h2>Aryabhata (476‚Äì550 CE)</h2>
  <img src="https://www.hua.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Astronomy-of-the-Ancient-Indians_Banner-1.jpg" alt="Aryabhata">
  <p>
    Aryabhata, born in <b>Kusumapura (modern-day Patna)</b>, is often called the 
    <span class="highlight">father of Indian mathematics and astronomy</span>. 
    Even as a teenager, he amazed people with his deep understanding of numbers and the stars. 
    He studied at the great learning centers of <b>Nalanda</b> and <b>Kusumapura</b>, where he 
    wrote his famous book <i>Aryabhatiya</i> at the age of just 23.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Introduced the <b>place-value system with zero</b>, backbone of modern math & computing.</li>
    <li>Calculated <b>œÄ ‚âà 3.1416</b> with amazing accuracy for his time.</li>
    <li>Proposed Earth rotates on its axis, centuries before Europe accepted it.</li>
    <li>Explained <b>solar & lunar eclipses</b> using shadow theory instead of myths.</li>
    <li>Laid the basics of <b>trigonometry</b> (sine functions).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    His work spread to the Islamic world and later Europe, directly influencing the 
    <span class="highlight">Renaissance</span>. From humble beginnings, Aryabhata‚Äôs 
    brilliance traveled across continents.
  </p>

  <!-- Brahmagupta -->
  <h2>Brahmagupta (598‚Äì668 CE)</h2>
  <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F630nQCW8AIdmX9?format=jpg&name=4096x4096" alt="Brahmagupta">
  <p>
    Born in <b>Bhinmal (Rajasthan)</b>, Brahmagupta became the head of the great 
    astronomical observatory at <b>Ujjain</b>. His life‚Äôs work revolved around explaining 
    the mysteries of the universe with numbers. His book <i>Brahmasphutasiddhanta</i> 
    was so advanced that it later traveled to Baghdad and powered the Islamic Golden Age of science.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Defined rules for <b>zero, negative numbers, and arithmetic operations</b>.</li>
    <li>Systematically solved <b>quadratic equations</b>.</li>
    <li>Improved models for <b>planetary motion and eclipses</b>.</li>
    <li>Laid foundations for algebra that reached Europe centuries later.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    From a desert town to the world stage, Brahmagupta showed how 
    <span class="highlight">Indian genius in numbers</span> could shape global knowledge.
  </p>

  <!-- Bhaskaracharya -->
  <h2>Bhaskaracharya (1114‚Äì1185 CE)</h2>
  <img src="https://www.booksfact.com/images/science/ancient_science/bhaskaracharya.jpg" alt="Bhaskaracharya">
  <p>
    Bhaskaracharya, born in <b>Bijapur, Karnataka</b>, carried forward the 
    torch of Indian mathematics. He led the astronomical school at <b>Ujjain</b> 
    and wrote masterpieces that combined creativity with logic. His work inspired 
    not just scholars but also students through his playful teaching style.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Authored <i>Siddhanta Shiromani</i>, covering arithmetic, algebra, and astronomy.</li>
    <li>Wrote <i>Lilavati</i>, a math text full of <b>puzzles and problem-solving tricks</b>.</li>
    <li>Anticipated ideas of <b>calculus</b> long before Newton or Leibniz.</li>
    <li>Explained concepts close to <b>gravity</b> and planetary attraction.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    His daughter <b>Lilavati</b> inspired one of his famous works, proving 
    that Indian scholars valued <span class="highlight">teaching and legacy</span> 
    as much as discovery.
  </p>

  <!-- Varahamihira -->
  <h2>VarƒÅhamihira (505‚Äì587 CE)</h2>
  <img src="https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/varahamihira.jpg" alt="Varahamihira">
  <p>
    Varahamihira, from <b>Ujjain</b>, was a true ‚ÄúRenaissance man‚Äù of ancient India. 
    He mastered <b>astronomy, astrology, architecture, botany, and geology</b>. 
    His works show how Indian science was not just theory but had real-life uses 
    in farming, building, and navigation.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Compiled <i>Panchasiddhantika</i>, summarizing 5 schools of astronomy.</li>
    <li>Linked <b>astronomy with astrology, calendars, and architecture</b>.</li>
    <li>Guided farmers and rulers with <b>weather predictions</b>.</li>
    <li>Accurately predicted eclipses without modern instruments.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    His genius lay in making science <span class="highlight">practical and useful</span>, 
    helping ordinary people while also guiding kings.

  <h2>üìä From Ancient Math to Data Science</h2>
  <p>
    Ancient Indian scholars were the world‚Äôs earliest <span class="highlight">data scientists</span>. 
    They collected observations, found <b>patterns</b>, and built <b>formulas</b> to make predictions.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>üìê Aryabhata‚Äôs calculations = early <b>algorithms</b>.</li>
    <li>‚ûï Brahmagupta‚Äôs zero = foundation of <b>binary code</b>.</li>
    <li>üìè Bhaskaracharya‚Äôs methods = precursors to <b>calculus & machine learning</b>.</li>
    <li>üî≠ Varahamihira‚Äôs applied science = like today‚Äôs <b>data-driven decision making</b>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Concepts like <b>zero, infinity, trigonometry, and calculus</b> 
    still drive modern fields from AI to space exploration.
