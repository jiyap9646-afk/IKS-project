    <p>
      India was at the center of <span class="highlight">world trade</span> for centuries. 
      Spices like black pepper, cardamom, and cinnamon were called ‚Äúblack gold‚Äù in Rome. 
      Cotton textiles from Gujarat and silk from Bengal reached as far as Egypt and China. 
      Trade routes connected India with <b>Rome, Southeast Asia, Persia, and China</b>, 
      making India a global hub of commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such large-scale trade, merchants had to maintain <b>records of goods, routes, and payments</b>. 
      Ships left from Indian ports loaded with spices, ivory, and pearls, while returning with gold, silver, and wine. 
      This exchange wasn‚Äôt random ‚Äî it was carefully <span class="highlight">documented and analyzed</span> 
      by traders to ensure profits, reduce risks, and plan future voyages.
    </p>

    <img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/old-indian-coins-background-currency-india-ancient-266132298.jpg" alt="Ancient Coins">
    <p>
      Ancient Indian merchants and kingdoms issued <span class="highlight">coins</span> 
      that carried symbols of rulers, deities, or dynasties. These coins were not just 
      money ‚Äî they were a form of <b>information storage</b>. Historians today can read 
      these coins to know about rulers, economy, and even international connections. 
      The <b>Gupta dynasty</b> was famous for its gold coins with detailed art and inscriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some coins even reveal the <b>extent of trade</b>: Indo-Greek coins show cultural mixing, 
      while Roman coins found in South India prove how strong the spice trade was. 
      In a way, coins acted as ‚Äúdata carriers‚Äù ‚Äî each piece telling a story of political power, 
      trade connections, and economic health.
    </p>

    <p>
      Merchant guilds (called <span class="highlight">Shrenis</span>) were powerful organizations 
      that maintained <b>records of trade, taxes, and exports</b>. These acted as early ledgers 
      ‚Äî similar to how companies today keep financial statements. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The guilds also <b>regulated prices, quality, and contracts</b>, ensuring fair business. 
      Records were written on palm leaves, copper plates, or stone inscriptions. 
      Ports like <b>Lothal, Tamralipti, and Muziris</b> were centers of record-keeping and 
      customs management, where scribes documented incoming and outgoing ships.  
      This was a form of <span class="highlight">ancient business intelligence</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The tradition of trade and data recording has never stopped. Even today, 
      India is a major exporter of textiles, gems, and technology services. 
      While ancient merchants wrote on palm leaves and stone inscriptions, 
      today‚Äôs trade data is stored in <b>digital databases, customs systems, 
      and even blockchain ledgers</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Governments now use <b>big data analytics</b> to track imports and exports. 
      Artificial Intelligence helps predict global demand, while supply chains 
      are optimized through real-time data. The tools are modern, but the logic 
      remains the same ‚Äî <b>careful data keeping leads to successful trade</b>.

      <h2>üí° Did You Know?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Roman ships carried so many Indian goods that gold coins flooded into India.</li>
        <li>Spices from Kerala were so valuable that <b>colonial powers fought wars</b> to control them.</li>
        <li>The port city of Lothal (2400 BCE) had one of the world‚Äôs first <b>dockyards</b>.</li>
        <li>Some Indian merchants even kept coded trade secrets to protect business knowledge.</li>

  <h2>üí∞ From Trade Records to Data Science</h2>
  <p>
    Ancient traders carefully noted quantities, routes, profits, and taxes ‚Äî 
    just like today‚Äôs <span class="highlight">data scientists</span> track sales, markets, 
    and predictions. Where guilds once maintained written ledgers, 
    we now use <b>databases, spreadsheets, and AI models</b>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Modern systems like <b>digital banking, blockchain, and supply chain analytics</b> 
    are the natural evolution of what started thousands of years ago. 
    The same principle remains: <b>record, analyze, and predict</b>. 
    Ancient coins and trade logs are the ancestors of the data-driven world we live in today.
