    <h1>Ayurveda in Ancient India</h1>
  </header>


  <div class="container">


    <p>
      Ayurveda, meaning the <span class="highlight">‚Äúscience of life‚Äù</span>, is one of the world‚Äôs
      oldest systems of medicine, rooted in India more than <b>3,000 years ago</b>. It emphasizes
      balance of body, mind, and spirit, focusing on <b>prevention, healing, and lifestyle harmony</b>.
      Unlike modern medicine, which often treats only symptoms, Ayurveda focused on the root causes of
      illness, making it one of the most holistic healthcare systems in the world.
    </p>


    <h2>Foundations of Ayurveda</h2>
    <p>
      Ayurveda is based on the concept of <b>five elements</b> (earth, water, fire, air, space) and
      their combination into three <span class="highlight">doshas</span>: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha.
      Health was believed to depend on keeping these doshas in balance through diet, lifestyle,
      herbs, and therapies. Each person had a unique ‚ÄúPrakriti‚Äù (constitution), and treatment was
      highly personalized. This approach made Ayurveda an early form of <b>customized medicine</b>.
    </p>


    <h2>Key Ancient Texts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Charaka Samhita</b> ‚Äì Focused on internal medicine, nutrition, and disease prevention. It also discussed medical ethics, diagnosis, and the importance of a physician‚Äôs behavior.</li>
      <li><b>Sushruta Samhita</b> ‚Äì Specialized in surgery, detailing <b>300+ surgical procedures</b> and instruments. It described methods like plastic surgery, fracture treatment, and even cesarean operations.</li>
      <li><b>Ashtanga Hridaya</b> ‚Äì Covered general principles, diagnosis, and therapies. It unified earlier works and served as a guidebook for centuries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Treatments and Practices</h2>
    <p>
      Ayurveda included <b>herbal medicines, oils, yoga, and meditation</b> for physical and mental well-being.
      Therapies like <span class="highlight">Panchakarma</span> (detoxification) were used for cleansing
      the body. Other treatments included <b>leech therapy, detox diets, and specialized massages</b>.
      Surgery, pioneered by Sushruta, included techniques like cataract removal and plastic surgery,
      centuries before such methods appeared in Europe.

    <h2>Global Influence</h2>
    <p>
      Ayurveda spread to <b>Tibet, China, Sri Lanka, and later the Middle East</b>.
      Through translations into Persian and Arabic, it influenced <b>Greek and Roman medicine</b>.
      Arab scholars like Avicenna drew upon Ayurvedic principles, which later reached Europe.
      In modern times, Ayurveda has influenced practices such as <b>homeopathy, naturopathy, and integrative medicine</b>.
    </p>

    <div class="facts-box">
    <h2>Ayurveda and Data Science</h2>
    <p>
      Ayurveda may be ancient, but it shares surprising similarities with <b>data science</b>.
      Just like data scientists classify and analyze patterns, Ayurvedic practitioners studied
      vast data on <b>symptoms, diets, and treatments</b> over centuries to find what works best.
      The concept of <span class="highlight">Prakriti</span> (individual constitution) is similar
      to <b>personalized analytics</b>, where each person‚Äôs data determines the treatment.
      Today, modern researchers are applying <b>machine learning</b> to Ayurvedic records to
      validate traditional remedies and design <b>AI-driven personalized healthcare</b>.
